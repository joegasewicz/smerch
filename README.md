# Smerch
A high-performance Python package manager written in Go.

Inspired by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) & [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

### Project status
At this stage this is just an experiment to see if I can write a package manager in Go that is considerably more performant than existing solutions.

### Why does this project exist?
There are a growing number of Python developers that have also picked up Go.
 
Therefore, it makes sense to build a package manager in a language that enables these developers to read & 
understand the source code & to be able to contribute to it.
